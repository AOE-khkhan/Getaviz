![master](https://codeship.com/projects/409e3130-0a2e-0133-98c2-269fed99bda5/status?branch=master)

## Development Team

Getaviz is developed by the research group [Softwarevisualization In 3D And Virtual Reality](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/) of Leipzig University. It has been developed over several years and is the basic for many scientific publications. In 2018 we released Getaviz as open source to simplify collaboration and practical use of our research prototype. 

Currently, four developers are contributung actively to Getavip:
* Dr. Richard MÃ¼ller
* Dr. Jan Schilbach
* Pascal Kovacs
* David Baum

Have a look at our [website](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/) for more information about our research group, visualization examples, and our publications. We are looking for collaborations with researchers and developers/companies. If you are interested, please contact us via email.

## How do I get set up? ###

The recommended way is **not** to clone this repository, but to follow the instructions under [Oomph Setup](../wiki/Oomph%20Setup).
Each subdirectory of this repository represents a standalone component of Getaviz. It contains a separate README.MD with further instructions and documentation.

## Wiki

Please have a look at our [Wiki](../wiki/Home) which contains many additional information. However, documentation is still incomplete. Feel free to open an issue if you have any question!
